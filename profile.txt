My favorite food: Mac & Cheese, because I love the cheese and the flavor.
My favorite sport: Archery or ice skating, because I suck at most other sports, and I find archery and ice skating fun.
My favorite STEM thing: Messing around with html using the inspect tool, becuase you can make some pretty funny things with it.
